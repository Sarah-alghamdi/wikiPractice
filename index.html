                            figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance,
                            and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular
                            culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video
                            performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave
                            the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded individual music artist in history.

                                The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with
                                his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5
                                (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown
                                Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos,
                                including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his 1982 album
                                Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an

                                He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums
                                Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995).
                                Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to
                                produce five U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.
                                From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his
                                changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of
                                sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil
                                court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and
                                acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI
                                found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf in either case. In 2009, while
                                preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose
                                of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in
                                2011 of involuntary manslaughter.

                                Michael Joseph Jackson[9][10] was born in Gary, Indiana, on August 29, 1958.[11][12] He
                                was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American
                                family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street.[13][14] His mother, Katherine
                                Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a
                                country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears.[15] She was a Jehovah's
                                Witness.[16] His father, Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane
                                operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the
                                Falcons, to supplement the family's income.[17][18] Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack"
                                Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine
                                man.[19] Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five
                                brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy).[17] A sixth brother, Marlon's twin
                                Brandon, died shortly after birth.[20]

                                In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father
                                which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and
                                tambourine.[21][22] Michael said his father told him he had a "fat nose",[23] and
                                physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat
                                in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to punish any
                                mistakes.[16][24] Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael.[25] Katherine said
                                that although whipping came to be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline
                                children when Michael was growing up.[26][27] Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied
                                that their father was abusive and said that the whippings, which were harder on Michael
                                because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble.[28] Jackson said his
                                youth was lonely and isolated.

                            <p>Later in 1964, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was
                                changed to the Jackson 5.[30] In 1965, the group won a talent show; Michael performed
                                the dance to Robert Parker's 1965 song "Barefootin'" and sang the Temptations' "My
                                Girl".[31] From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the Midwest; they frequently played
                                at a string of black clubs known as the Chitlin' Circuit as the opening act for artists
                                such as Sam & Dave, the O'Jays, Gladys Knight, and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also
                                performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at
                                local auditoriums and high school dances.[32][33] In August 1967, while touring the East
                                Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.</p>

                                On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before the first This Is It show was due to
                                begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from cardiac arrest, caused by
                                a propofol and benzodiazepine overdose.[294][295] Conrad Murray, his personal physician,
                                had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby
                                Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22 pm Pacific time (19:22 UTC)
                                and arrived three minutes later.[296][297] Jackson was not breathing and CPR was
                                performed.[298] Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical
                                Center, and for more than an hour after Jackson's arrival there, but were
                                unsuccessful,[299][300] and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26
                                UTC).[301][302]

                                Jackson was administered propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam;[303] his death was caused
                                by a propofol overdose.[295][300] News of his death spread quickly online, causing
                                websites to slow down and crash from user overload,[304] and putting unprecedented
                                strain[305] on services and websites including Google,[306] AOL Instant Messenger,[305]
                                Twitter, and Wikipedia.[306] Overall, web traffic rose by between 11% and 20%.[307][308]
                                MTV and BET aired marathons of Jackson's music videos,[309] and Jackson specials aired
                                on television stations around the world.[310] MTV briefly returned to its original music
                                video format,[11] and aired hours of Jackson's music videos, with live news specials
                                featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities.
